# SINN-Seismic-Intelligent-Noise-Neutralizer-
The best solution to reducing energy-consumption in rovers sent to different planets, to study the seismic signals of the planet.
<h2>High-Level Summary</h2>
This project focuses on developing a seismic event detection system, specifically processing seismic data from planetary bodies such as the Moon (Lunar seismic data). The system processes velocity time-series data to detect and visualize seismic events, marking points where the seismic activity crosses predefined thresholds. The output includes both time-series plots and spectrograms, providing a comprehensive visual representation of seismic phenomena.
<h2>Project Demo</h2>
The demo involves the following steps:
Data Loading: Seismic data is loaded from CSV files containing time and velocity information.
Seismic Event Detection: A Python-based algorithm identifies seismic events by analyzing the velocity data and comparing it to calculated thresholds.
Visualization: The data is visualized with time-series plots showing velocity and marked events, along with spectrograms that highlight the frequency distribution during these events
<h2>Final Project</h2>
The final product of this project will be a fully functional seismic event detection system that:
Processes seismic data (either real or simulated) from planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars.(.csv files)
Utilizes advanced signal processing and (Nair and Patil)Algorithms to automatically identify and detect seismic events.
Generates time-series plots and spectrograms for visualization, marking seismic events fun and interactive for users.
Can be applied in space research or planetary exploration missions to detect, analyze, and study seismic activity.
